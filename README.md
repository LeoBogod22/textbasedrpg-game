Python text based rpg game with some ASCII graphics.. It is by no means a professional  game, but I think there is some good code here. 



# Game



the game starts of in the root of the rpository with the player choosing his character and style. After that he chooses where he would like to go,  the game involves 3 quests and 4 battles. The player may enter the shop any time by pressing S on his keybord.


 All classes have a health stat. If you are a warrior or an archer, you will get an additional stamina stat. If you are a mage, you will get an additional mana stat. Attacks for warriors and archers use stamina, and attacks for mages use mana. At the start of each turn in the battle, both you and your enemy will restore a small amount of stamina/mana.  Items increase your attack damage, armor increases your health , and potions restore your health

Game includes a shop , if your a mage you can buy staffs and spellboks , if your a warrior you can buy daggers and swords to increase your damage.
